# RFM Customer Analysis Project

## Overview
This report delivers a strategic analysis of the companyâ€™s customer base through the lens of the RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) model, with the goal of maximizing marketing efficiency and strengthening customer relationships. By segmenting customers into well-defined groups, the analysis empowers the team to craft personalized strategies that directly support next quarter's sales objectives.

Through the application of RFM metrics, capturing how recently, how often, and how much customers spend, the report uncovers actionable insights into customer behavior. These insights will enable the marketing team to design more targeted, data-driven campaigns that resonate with each segment and drive meaningful results.
